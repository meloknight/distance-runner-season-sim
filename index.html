          <li>
            The season consists of a chosen year and runs from the start of
            March to the end of September.
          </li>
          <li>
            The season is made up of a competitive Conference which contains 20
            Teams. Each team is made up of 8 individual Runners.
          </li>
          <li>
            All 160 runners are generated at the start of the season and have
            numerous characteristics determined for them at the start of the
            season. These factors are physical, training, nutritional,
            psychological, biomechanical, and genetic factors.
          </li>
          <li>
            All of these factors are then combined into a "skill class" for each
            race length. This means that a runner may be better at certain race
            distances if they have a certain mix of strong factors.
          </li>
          <li>
            From here, a schedule for the season's races is created allocating 2
            to 5 races on every second weekend. The runners are then allocated
            to those races.
          </li>
          <li>
            The runners then have a weather, terrain, and luck modifier added to
            their skill class in the case the race aligns with their preferred
            weather and/or terrain. The luck modifier is determined for each
            race since a runner may feel sick, have an injury, or be in the zone
            on a race day.
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, all the races are run, winners are selected by highest
            raceday skill class, and points are determined. Golds count for 3
            points, silvers for 2 points, and bronzes for 1 point.
